# LLM from Scratch

Welcome to **LLM from Scratch**, a personal project where I am learning and building the core components of Large Language Models by following the excellent [LLM from Scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch) series by Sebastian Raschka.

This repository is my personal hands-on journey where I break down complex LLM concepts and rebuild everything from scratch — starting with tokenizers all the way to full transformer blocks — to truly understand how it all works under the hood.

## Project Goals

- ✅ Understand each core component of modern LLMs.
- ✅ Implement components from scratch using PyTorch and Python.
- ✅ Document insights, experiments, and learnings.
- ✅ Build a fully functioning mini-GPT-style LLM.

## Credits

This project is heavily inspired by the excellent LLM from Scratch series by Sebastian Raschka.
All theoretical concepts and implementation ideas are based on his work, and this repository is my personal reimplementation and exploration of those concepts for learning purposes.

Hello,

About your first question, I also just started to CS50w and tried to use git to submit project 0 like you. And after some struggle, I managed to do it. I will try to help you about it.

1- Make sure about your file system. What I mean is, don't create new folders inside your project to wrap actual project files.

Ex: For project:0 which is search, make sure you are inside search/ folder and all your html+css inside of it.

2- git init

Go to your console inside vscode and use "git init". This will create a local repository inside your computer.

3- git add *

This will add all of your files to it.

4- git commit -m [yourMessage]

This will commit your changes and also "adding" to your local repository.

Keep working this way through the project, so you can track your work in this local repository.

When you finish with project and decided to submit;

5- git remote add [name] [URL]

This will connect your local repository with a remote repository, which is our me50 repository they created for us.

[name] = this is a random nickname for your remote, so you can use anything you want, but don't forget we will use this. For example, I used cs50 as a nickname.

[URL] = They actually gave this link to us in submit part of project. It was https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git. Don't forget to change USERNAME inside the link.

6- git push [name] [currentLocalBranch]:[theBranchNameTheyGiveYou]

This will push your local repository to remote, which we just added with a brand-new branch on it.

Let me explain variables here:

[name] = the nickname you just gave it to our me50 repository.

[currentLocalBranch] = when you use "git init", git automatically creates a branch which called master or main. You can learn your branch name in multiple ways;

a-) Check left bottom corner of your vscode, next beside of branch icon there will be a name for your current branch.

b-) Inside terminal while you're entering command it shows your current path and inside paranthesis your branch name like (master)

c-) use "git status" inside terminal, and you will see information message like "On branch master".

d-) use "git branch" inside terminal, and the name with asterisk left of it is your currently working branch.

[theBranchNameTheyGiveYou] = I think they will specify this for every project, but for search it was "web50/projects/2020/x/search".

After you're done with these steps, don't forget to check if it's correct via "https://github.com/me50/USERNAME/blob/web50/projects/2020/x/search/index.html" link they gave you.

Don't forget to change USERNAME inside the link, and you should see your index.html code.

Note: In git commands, be careful about spaces and ":"(colon).

Hope this helps, happy learning!
